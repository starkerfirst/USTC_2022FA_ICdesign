Legalizing 4010 illegal cells...
Starting legalizer.
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
	The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 73 sites
	and the median cell width is 19 sites. This makes it difficult for
	the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
	displacements and long runtimes. (PSYN-1012)
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of
	legalization to see the impact of the fragmentation.
Initial legalization:  10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% (0 sec)

Starting legalizer.
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
	The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 64 sites
	and the median cell width is 19 sites. This makes it difficult for
	the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
	displacements and long runtimes. (PSYN-1012)
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of

# Usage of Explore Mode Results
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# After the explore mode is completed, please review results in the HTML table
# - ${DESIGN_NAME}_explore.html, and choose one result to proceed with ICC-RM.
# It can be done by either of the following two approachs.
#
# 1.Use the saved CEL from the run chosen as the starting point for ICC-RM.
#   -> Please specify the varible ICC_FLOORPLAN_CEL in icc_setup.tcl with this
#      CEL name.
#   *  This CEL will contain fixed macro placement or In Place Optimization or
#      Power Network Synthesis changes depeding on what option you choose
#      during the run.
#   *  ICC_FLOORPLAN_CEL is the variable which you specify as the starting CEL
#      for ICC-RM.
#
# 2.Use the written-out floorplan and route files from the run you choose and
#   load them onto the original CEL.
#   -> Open CEL saved_cel_before_explore_mode, load the written-out floorplan
#      and route files. 
#   -> Save the CEL as a differnt name, and specify ICC_FLOORPLAN_CEL with this
#      CEL name. Then ICC-RM will start with this CEL.
#   *  This approach ensures no netlist change but only macro placement and PG
#      routes from the explore mode.   
#   *  saved_cel_before_explore_mode is the CEL saved before the explore mode
#      starts which is your clean starting point.
#   *  The written-out floorplan file is in $RESULTS_DIR which you can load by
#      using the following command: 
#      read_floorplan $RESULTS_DIR/run0_default_dump.floorplan  
#   *  The written-out route file is in $RESULTS_DIR which you can load by
#      using the following command:
#      read_floorplan $RESULTS_DIR/run0_default_dump.route
