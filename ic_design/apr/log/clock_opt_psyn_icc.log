#     tie_optimization - cell created at tie-optimization stage

Starting legalizer.
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
	The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 64 sites
	and the median cell width is 19 sites. This makes it difficult for
	the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
	displacements and long runtimes. (PSYN-1012)
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of

Legalizing 14 illegal cells...
Starting legalizer.
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
	The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 64 sites
	and the median cell width is 19 sites. This makes it difficult for
	the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
	displacements and long runtimes. (PSYN-1012)
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of
	legalization to see the impact of the fragmentation.

Legalizing 3442 illegal cells...
Starting legalizer.
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
	The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 64 sites
	and the median cell width is 19 sites. This makes it difficult for
	the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
	displacements and long runtimes. (PSYN-1012)
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of
	legalization to see the impact of the fragmentation.

# Categorized Timing Report (CTR)
# Use CTR in the interactive mode to view the results of create_qor_snapshot.
# Recommended to be used with GUI opened.
# query_qor_snapshot -display (or GUI: Timing -> Query QoR Snapshot)
#
# query_qor_snapshot condenses the timing report into a cross-referencing
# table for quick analysis. It can be used to highlight violating paths and
# metric in the layout window and timing reports. CTR also provides special
# options to focus on top-level and hierarchical timing issues. When dealing
# with dirty designs, increasing the number violations per path to 20-30 when
# generating a snapshot can help finding more issues after each run
# (create_qor_snapshot -max_paths 20).
